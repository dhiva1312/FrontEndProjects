            <p className='text-justify px-5 pb-5 text-white'>At UniQin.ai, I worked as a Software Developer from July 2023 to June 2024, where I played a key role in designing, developing, and maintaining web applications with a focus on frontend technologies. I successfully developed an E-commerce website utilizing Vue.js and the Quasar framework, and a comprehensive sign-up flow featuring sign-in, sign-up, password reset, WhatsApp integration, and more. Additionally, I leveraged React.js for various projects, enhancing my skills in state management, component reusability, and user authentication. My work ensured efficient, scalable, and user-centric solutions, contributing to the companyâ€™s product offerings and overall success.</p>
